# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & DevSecOps Portfolio
Welcome to my Cybersecurity & DevSecOps Portfolio — a curated collection of projects demonstrating my practical skills in application security, DevSecOps pipelines, cloud security, threat detection, and vulnerability management.

This repository serves as my technical showcase, blending my software engineering background with my current specialisation in cybersecurity and DevSecOps.

---

# 🎯 Project Goals
✅ Implement end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline across phases: Plan → Code → Test → Build → Release → Deploy → Run
✅ Demonstrate secure application development using Astro + Node.js
✅ Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools (SAST, DAST, Secrets scanning) into CI/CD
✅ Leverage AWS cloud security best practices for deployment and monitoring
✅ Document threat models, pentest results, vulnerability management, and security posture in a transparent way
