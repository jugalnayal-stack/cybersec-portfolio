# 🛡️ DevSecOps & Cloud Security Portfolio
Welcome to my hands-on DevSecOps portfolio a curated collection of projects and practices that demonstrate secure software delivery pipelines, infrastructure as code, threat modeling, runtime monitoring, and continuous compliance.

This repository is not just about code it’s about how code gets built, secured, tested, deployed, and monitored in production using open-source tools and cloud-native practices.
